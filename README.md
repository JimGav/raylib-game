# raylib-game
This is a simple game I made to get familiar with C++ raylib. For the moment it is just a circle with some kb/m interractions but I might evolve it to something more interesting in the future.

# How to run
Download main.exe and run it.
## Or
- Install the repository locally by either cloning it or downloading the code.
```git clone https://github.com/JimGav/raylib-game.git```
- Cd into the repository.
```cd raylib-game```
- Run the game using ```make run```. (Make sure you have Makefile installed and all the necessary compiler configurations set up. I will add more options for compilation soon.).

# Controls
- WASD - Control the shooter.
- Left Mouse Button - Shoot a projectile.
- Right Mouse Button - Drag a projectile and throw it changing its direction.
